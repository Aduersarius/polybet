# Hedging Dashboard - Admin Panel Guide

## How Hedging Works

When users place orders on Pariflow, the system can automatically hedge these positions on external liquidity providers. This ensures:

1. **Risk Management**: Platform exposure is minimized
2. **Price Discovery**: Prices reflect broader market sentiment
3. **Liquidity**: Users get better execution on larger orders

### Low Success Rate

**Causes:**

2. Adjust spread settings
3. Enable order splitting for large orders

### High Unhedged Exposure

2. Investigate failure reasons
3. Consider manual intervention for large positions

## Best Practices

2. **Monitor Closely**: Watch metrics during initial operation
3. **Adjust Gradually**: Make small configuration changes
4. **Secure Credentials**: Follow security best practices for all secrets
5. **Test First**: Verify configuration before enabling in production
