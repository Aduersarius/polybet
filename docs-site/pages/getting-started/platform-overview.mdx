# Platform Overview

Pariflow is a production-grade prediction market platform where users trade on future outcomes using a sophisticated hybrid trading system.

## What is a Prediction Market?

A prediction market is a platform where users can buy and sell shares in the outcome of future events. The price of shares represents the market's collective probability assessment of that outcome occurring.

**Example:**
- Event: "Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by 2025"
- YES shares at $0.65 = 65% probability
- NO shares at $0.35 = 35% probability

## Key Features

## Trading Mechanics

### AMM Pricing

Uses LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) for fair pricing:

```
Price = 1 / (1 + e^((q_no - q_yes) / b))
```

Where:
- `q_yes` = Total YES tokens bought
- `q_no` = Total NO tokens bought
- `b` = Liquidity parameter

### Order Matching

Orders are matched with priority:
1. **Price Priority**: Best prices first
2. **Time Priority**: Earlier orders first
3. **AMM Fallback**: Unfilled amounts execute against AMM

### Fees

- **Trading Fees**: Small fee per trade (typically 2%)
- **Withdrawal Fees**: Minimal blockchain fees
- **No Deposit Fees**: Free deposits

## Security

- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.
