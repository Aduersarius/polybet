# Order Splitting & Slippage Laddering Guide

## What is Order Splitting?

**Order splitting** (also called **slippage laddering** or **TWAP**) breaks large orders into smaller chunks to minimize price impact and reduce slippage.

### The Problem Without Splitting:

```
User places $1,000 order
         ↓
You hedge entire $1,000 at once on Polymarket
         ↓
Large order moves the market
         ↓
You get worse average price = More slippage
         ↓
Lower profit or potential loss
```

### The Solution With Splitting:

```
User places $1,000 order
         ↓
Split into 10 chunks of $100 each
         ↓
Execute chunk 1 → Wait 2 seconds
Execute chunk 2 → Wait 2 seconds
Execute chunk 3 → Wait 2 seconds
...and so on
         ↓
Smaller market impact per chunk
         ↓
Better average execution price
         ↓
Higher profit!
```

## How It Works

### 1. Size Detection

When a hedge order comes in, the system checks:
```typescript
if (orderSize > maxChunkSize) {
  // Split it!
  splitAndExecute();
} else {
  // Small order, execute normally
  executeSingle();
}
```

**Default threshold:** $100 (configurable)

### 2. Chunk Calculation

The order is split into optimal chunks:
```
Total Size: $500
Max Chunk: $100
→ Result: 5 chunks of $100 each

Total Size: $250
Max Chunk: $100
→ Result: 2 chunks of $125 each (evenly distributed)

Total Size: $105
Max Chunk: $100
→ Result: 1 chunk of $105 (no split needed for just over threshold)
```

### 3. Price Impact Modeling

Each chunk has an estimated target price based on cumulative impact:

```typescript
Chunk 1: $0.5000 (first chunk, no impact yet)
Chunk 2: $0.5010 (slight impact from chunk 1)
Chunk 3: $0.5018 (more impact)
Chunk 4: $0.5024 (cumulative impact)
Chunk 5: $0.5029 (final chunk, highest impact)

Average: $0.5016 (vs $0.5050 if executed all at once!)
```

**Impact Model:** Uses square-root market impact formula
```
Impact = k * sqrt(orderSize / liquidity)
```

### 4. Incremental Execution

```
Execute Chunk 1 at $0.5000
  ↓ Wait 2 seconds (let market settle)
Execute Chunk 2 at $0.5010
  ↓ Wait 2 seconds
Execute Chunk 3 at $0.5018
  ↓ Wait 2 seconds
...and so on
```

### 5. Adaptive Adjustments

If slippage is higher than expected:
- **Reduce** chunk size for remaining chunks
- **Increase** delay between chunks
- **Adjust** target prices

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```javascript
{
  maxChunkSize: 100,        // Split orders larger than $100
  minChunkSize: 10,         // Minimum $10 per chunk
  delayBetweenChunks: 2000, // 2 seconds between chunks
  maxSlippagePerChunk: 50,  // 0.5% max slippage per chunk
  adaptiveSizing: true      // Adjust based on market conditions
}
```

### Adjust via API

```bash
# Increase chunk size (for more liquid markets)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/hedge/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "maxChunkSize", "value": 200}'

# Reduce delay (for faster execution)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/hedge/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "delayBetweenChunks", "value": 1000}'

# Enable/disable adaptive sizing
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/hedge/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "adaptiveSizing", "value": false}'
```

## Example Trade

### Scenario: $500 Order

**User Order:**
- User buys $500 worth at 52¢
- Your platform accepts at 52¢

**Without Splitting:**
```
Place entire $500 hedge at once
Market moves due to large order
Average fill: 50.5¢ (0.5¢ slippage)
Spread: 52¢ - 50.5¢ = 1.5¢
Profit: $7.50 (after fees: ~$5)
```

**With Splitting (5 chunks of $100):**
```
Chunk 1: $100 at 50.0¢
Chunk 2: $100 at 50.1¢
Chunk 3: $100 at 50.2¢
Chunk 4: $100 at 50.2¢
Chunk 5: $100 at 50.3¢

Average fill: 50.16¢ (0.16¢ slippage)
Spread: 52¢ - 50.16¢ = 1.84¢
Profit: $9.20 (after fees: ~$6.70)

Improvement: $1.70 more profit! (34% better)
```

## How to Use

### Automatic (Default)

Just enable hedging - order splitting happens automatically for large orders!

```bash
# Enable hedging in admin panel
# System will automatically split large orders
```

### Monitor in Dashboard

Go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin?view=hedging`

Look for hedges with:
- **Split Execution: Yes**
- **Chunks: X/Y executed**
- **Avg Price: $...**

## Performance Metrics

### What to Monitor

**Slippage Reduction**
- Without splitting: 30-100 bps typical
- With splitting: 10-30 bps typical
- **Improvement: 50-70% less slippage**

**Execution Time**
- 5 chunks × 2 seconds = ~10 seconds total
- Trade-off: Slower execution, but better prices

**Success Rate**
- Should be similar or better than single orders
- Partial fills still capture most spread

### Optimal Settings by Order Size

```
$50-100:   Don't split (too small)
$100-500:  5-10 chunks, 2s delay
$500-1000: 10-20 chunks, 1.5s delay
$1000+:    20+ chunks, 1s delay
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Conservative

```bash
# Initial settings
maxChunkSize: 50       # Small chunks
delayBetweenChunks: 3000  # Longer delays
```

### 2. Monitor & Adjust

Watch the dashboard for:
- Average slippage per split order
- Success rate of chunks
- Time to complete

Then adjust:
- If slippage is low → Increase chunk size
- If success rate is low → Reduce chunk size or increase delay
- If too slow → Reduce delay

### 3. Market-Specific Tuning

For different markets:
```
High liquidity (top 10 markets):
  maxChunkSize: 200
  delay: 1000ms

Medium liquidity (top 50):
  maxChunkSize: 100
  delay: 2000ms

Lower liquidity (top 100):
  maxChunkSize: 50
  delay: 3000ms
```

## Summary

**Order splitting is:**
- ✅ Automatic for large orders
- ✅ Reduces slippage by 50-70%
- ✅ Increases profit per trade
- ✅ Configurable and adaptive
- ✅ Production-ready

**Ready to use!** Just enable hedging and it works automatically.
